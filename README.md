# Text-classification, full implementation from scratch (no libraries): 
Text classification using Bernoulli Naive Bayes:

- Data cleaning and vectorizing
- BernoullliNB implementation from scratch 
- The data train.csv and test.csv should be in the same folder as the bernoulliNB.py

To run the code:

```bash
$ python3 bernoulliNB.py
```

The output is a csv file containing the prediction for the test set.


# Text-classification, with libraries
Comparison of different models:

```bash
$ python3 with_libraries.py
```
info.csv is the output containing the accuracy score of BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB, SVM and GuassianNB models implemented for comparison.
